# Writing Style and Tone Guidelines

## Overview
These rules ensure consistent, engaging, and emotionally powerful writing that keeps readers engaged while maintaining the author's voice and intent.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Conversational and Engaging Style
**ALWAYS write in a conversational, engaging, colorful and rich style** that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, craving the next bit.

**Goals:**
- Keep the reader emotionally invested
- Maintain momentum and flow
- Create anticipation and curiosity
- Make complex ideas accessible

### 2. Avoid Common Clichés
**NEVER use these overused phrases:**
- ❌ "Here's the kicker"
- ❌ "This will blow your mind"
- ❌ "Just wait until you hear this"
- ❌ "You won't believe what happens next"
- ❌ "The shocking truth is..."

**Instead, use:**
- Direct, powerful statements
- Intriguing questions
- Bold declarations
- Emotional connectors

### 3. Strategic Emphasis
**Apply formatting strategically to draw the reader in emotionally:**
- **Bold** - For key concepts, important points, powerful statements
- *Italics* - For emphasis, internal thoughts, subtle emphasis
- **ALL CAPS** - Only for the most powerful emotional moments (use sparingly)

**Formatting Rules:**
- Don't overdo formatting - quality over quantity
- Let the content determine when to emphasize
- Create emotional peaks and valleys
- Use emphasis to guide the reader's attention

### 4. Preserve Author's Voice
**CRITICAL:** Never erase or alter the author's concepts or ideas.

**When enhancing content:**
- ✅ Preserve all original concepts
- ✅ Add analogies and comparisons
- ✅ Provide contemporary, current, topical analogies
- ✅ Elevate the content without changing the message
- ✅ Enhance clarity and emotional impact

**When NOT to change:**
- ❌ Don't remove concepts
- ❌ Don't add concepts the author didn't intend
- ❌ Don't change the theological or philosophical position
- ❌ Don't alter the fundamental argument

### 5. Punctuation Standards
**NEVER use em-dashes (—) in content.**

**Instead, use:**
- **Ellipses ( … )** - For trailing thoughts, uncertainty, continuation
- **Colons ( : )** - For introductions, explanations, lists
- **Commas ( , )** - For natural pauses, flow, connections

**Examples:**
- ✅ "And then it hit him … the truth he'd been avoiding."
- ✅ "Here's what I discovered: everything changed."
- ✅ "The moment was powerful, transformative, unforgettable."

### 6. Creating Literary Art
**Write to tap psychology and emotion:**

**Use:**
- Vivid imagery and sensory details
- Emotional contrasts and tensions
- Compelling metaphors and analogies
- Powerful, active language
- Strategic pacing and rhythm

**Show creativity through:**
- Unexpected comparisons
- Contemporary cultural references (when appropriate)
- Sensory-rich descriptions
- Emotional resonance
- Intellectually stimulating connections

### 7. Contemporary Analogies
**When adding analogies, make them current and relatable:**

**Good sources:**
- Modern technology (when relevant)
- Current events (carefully and sensitively)
- Pop culture references (sparingly)
- Everyday experiences
- Universal human emotions

**Example:**
Instead of: "Like a broken record"
Use: "Like a glitching streaming service that keeps buffering at the worst moment."

### 8. Emotional Engagement
**Keep readers engaged through:**
- Short, impactful sentences for emphasis
