  "description": "Escape The Hell Myth is a groundbreaking biblical study that exposes how the doctrine of eternal torment was built on mistranslations of Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and the Greek word aionios. Author Ansilo Boff reveals that Jesus never taught hell as a place of endless punishment, instead proclaiming a loving Father and universal reconciliation for all humanity. This book offers psychological healing from religious trauma, chronic spiritual anxiety, and fear-based Christianity, guiding readers from terror to trust through careful examination of what Jesus actually taught about judgment, fire, and the afterlife. Perfect for those questioning traditional hell theology, deconstructing harmful religious beliefs, or seeking freedom from the guilt and fear that eternal conscious torment doctrine creates.",
